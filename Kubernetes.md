# 🚀 Kubernetes (K8s) - Complete Overview and Resources

Kubernetes (K8s) is an 🛠️ open-source container orchestration platform that automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications 🚢. It is essential for managing microservices architecture 🖥️ with features like:

- 📈 Auto-scaling
- 🌐 Networking
- 📊 Monitoring
- ⚖️ Load balancing

## 🏗️ Kubernetes Architecture

Kubernetes follows a **client-server architecture** with **Master Nodes** and **Worker Nodes**.

### 1. Master Node Components 👑
| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **API Server** | Entry point for all REST operations on cluster objects |
| **Scheduler** | Places Pods on the most appropriate nodes |
| **Controller Manager** | Maintains desired state of the cluster |
| **etcd** | Key-value store for all cluster data |
| **Cloud Controller Manager** | Integrates Kubernetes with cloud providers |

### 2. Worker Node Components 🧑‍💻
| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Kubelet** | Ensures containers are running properly |
| **Kube Proxy** | Manages networking rules for Pod communication |
| **Container Runtime** | Executes containers (Docker, containerd) |

---

## 🔑 Key Kubernetes Components

- **Pods**: Smallest unit; encapsulates containers.
- **ReplicaSets**: Ensures defined number of Pods run at all times.
- **Deployments**: Manages ReplicaSets and provides rolling updates.
- **Services**: Exposes Pods using DNS and load balancing.
- **Namespaces**: Logical partitioning of cluster resources.

---

## 🚀 Why Kubernetes is Used

- 📈 **Scalability** – Auto scale apps with changing demand.
- 🏞️ **Portability** – Supports public, private, and hybrid clouds.
- 🤖 **Automation** – Handles self-healing, rollouts, updates.
- 🔋 **Efficiency** – Optimizes resource utilization.
- 🖥️ **Microservices Friendly** – Perfect for service-oriented apps.

## 📦 1. Pod

**Definition:**  
The smallest and simplest unit in Kubernetes. A Pod represents a single instance of a running process and can contain one or more containers.

**Use Case:**  
Running applications or services in containers.

**YAML:**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx-container
      image: nginx
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

## 🧬 2. ReplicaSet

**Definition:**  
Ensures a specified number of identical Pods are running at any given time. Often controlled by a Deployment.

**Use Case:** 
Maintaining a specific number of replicas for a Pod.

**YAML:**

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: my-replicaset
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```

## 🚀 3. Deployment
**Definition:**  
Provides declarative updates to Pods and manages ReplicaSets. Supports rolling updates, rollbacks, and scaling.

**Use Case:** 
Rolling updates, rollback, and horizontal scaling of applications.

**YAML:**

```yaml

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```
            
## 💾 4. StatefulSet
**Definition:**  
Used for managing stateful applications requiring persistent storage and stable network IDs. Maintains the order and uniqueness of Pods.

**Use Case:** 
Running databases and distributed systems.

**YAML:**

```yaml

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: my-statefulset
spec:
  serviceName: "nginx"
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```

##🛡️ 5. DaemonSet
**Definition:**  
Ensures a Pod runs on every node (or selected nodes) in the cluster. Commonly used for log collection, monitoring agents, etc.

**Use Case:** 
Running system-level services on all cluster nodes.

**YAML:**

```yaml

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: my-daemonset
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      name: log-agent
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: log-agent
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: fluentd
          image: fluent/fluentd
```

## 📅 6. Job
**Definition:**  
Manages the execution of one or more Pods to completion. Ensures the Pods terminate successfully.

**Use Case:** 
Running one-time or batch jobs (e.g., database backups).

**YAML:**

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: my-job
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      name: my-job-pod
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-job
          image: busybox
          command: ["echo", "Hello World"]
      restartPolicy: Never
  ```

## ⏰ 7. CronJob
**Definition:**  
Schedules Jobs to run at specific intervals, similar to cron jobs in Unix systems.

**Use Case:** 
Running tasks like backups, report generation, and cleanup on schedule.

**YAML:**

```yaml

apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: my-cronjob
spec:
  schedule: "*/5 * * * *"
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: hello
              image: busybox
              command: ["echo", "Scheduled Task"]
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
  ```
