# 🌐 Module 1: Introduction to Cloud

### 🤝 What is a Client-Server Model?

A **client** is an application (like a browser or desktop app) that sends requests, and a **server** (like an Amazon EC2 instance) responds to those requests. This architecture is the foundation of modern web computing.

## ☁️ Cloud Deployment Models

### 1⃣ Cloud-Based Deployment

* Entire application stack runs in the cloud.
* Migrate legacy apps or build new ones.
* Can use low-level services (like EC2) or managed services (like Lambda).

**Example**: An e-commerce platform hosted on EC2, RDS, and S3 within a cloud VPC.

### 2⃣ On-Premises Deployment (Private Cloud)

* All resources are deployed in a local data center.
* Uses tools like VMware, KVM, or Hyper-V for virtualization.
* Offers high control over infrastructure.

**Example**: Banking software running on-prem for compliance.

### 3⃣ Hybrid Deployment

* Combines on-premises systems with cloud services.
* Useful for legacy workloads, compliance, and gradual cloud migration.

**Example**: Use AWS Glue and Athena for big data while keeping ERP on-prem.

### ✅ Summary Table

| Deployment Model | Location | Use Case Example                    | Benefits                    |
| ---------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Cloud-Based      | Cloud    | SaaS, scalable applications         | Scalability, flexibility    |
| On-Premises      | Local DC | Compliance-heavy legacy systems     | Full control, data locality |
| Hybrid           | Mixed    | Gradual migration, hybrid analytics | Flexibility, balance        |

### 🧠 Key Takeaways

* Cloud computing offers multiple deployment models tailored to business and technical needs.
* The **client-server model** is central to how services interact over the internet.
* Hybrid deployments provide a bridge between legacy systems and cloud-native applications.

# 📊 Module 5: Storage and Database

## 📂 Instance Stores

Block-level storage volumes behave like physical hard drives.
An instance store provides temporary block-level storage for an Amazon EC2 instance. An instance store is disk storage that is physically attached to the host computer for an EC2 instance, and therefore has the same lifespan as the instance. When the instance is terminated, you lose any data in the instance store.

## 📀 Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)

Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) is a service that provides block-level storage volumes that you can use with Amazon EC2 instances. If you stop or terminate an Amazon EC2 instance, all the data on the attached EBS volume remains available.

To create an EBS volume, you define the configuration (such as volume size and type) and provision it. After you create an EBS volume, it can attach to an Amazon EC2 instance.

**Amazon EBS Snapshots:**

* An EBS snapshot is an incremental backup. This means that the first backup taken of a volume copies all the data. For subsequent backups, only the blocks of data that have changed since the most recent snapshot are saved.

## 📁 Object Storage

In object storage, each object consists of:

* **Data**: Any file such as image, video, document
* **Metadata**: Info about the data (type, size, usage)
* **Key**: Unique identifier

## 📀 Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)

Amazon S3 stores data as **objects in buckets** and offers:

* Unlimited storage
* Max object size: 5 TB

* **S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval**: Archive, fast access
* **S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval**: Archive, mins to hours
* **S3 Glacier Deep Archive**: Archive, 12-48 hours
* **S3 Outposts**: Object storage on AWS Outposts (on-prem)

# 🔐 Module 6: Security

## 🛡️ Shared responsibility model

**The AWS shared responsibility model**

AWS and the customer share responsibility for security and compliance.

* **AWS is responsible for "security OF the cloud"**, i.e., the infrastructure that runs all the services (hardware, software, networking, and physical facilities).
* **Customers are responsible for "security IN the cloud"**, i.e., customer data, identity and access management, encryption, and securing the services they use.

**🏠 Analogy**: AWS builds the house (cloud infrastructure), and the customer locks the doors and windows (data, apps, access control).

## 👥 IAM: Users, Policies, Roles, MFA

**AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)** provides:

* **👤 IAM Users** – individual identities with credentials and permissions
* **👥 IAM Groups** – collections of users managed together
* **📜 IAM Policies** – JSON documents that define permissions
* **🔁 IAM Roles** – temporary access to users/services to perform actions
* **🔐 MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)** – adds extra layer of security

**Root user** has full access — should be protected and rarely used.

**✅ Best practices**:

* Grant least privilege
* Use IAM roles over long-lived credentials
* Enforce MFA for critical users

### 🏢 AWS Organizations

**AWS Organizations** allows centralized management of multiple accounts:

* **Organizational Units (OUs)** – group accounts based on structure/policy
* **Service Control Policies (SCPs)** – set permission guardrails for accounts
* Use **consolidated billing** and apply compliance controls via SCPs

### 📋 Compliance
